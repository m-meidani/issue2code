## Dataset
You can load dataset\_df.pkl and issues\_df.pkl files as dataset files. These files are preprocessed and ready to feed to the network. If you want to build the dataset yourself, extract Dataset.zip file and then run alter\_dataset.py file to preprocess files.

## Model
The model-final.ipynb contains the latest version of the model. But, you can load our pretrained model using model-final.pth.tar file.
